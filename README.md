# data-science
Welcome to my data science repo. I'm a senior studying economics and data science with concentration in business and industrial analytics at UC Berkeley. 
I am interested in uncovering insights hidden behind the data deluge and help businesses make data-driven decisions based on the insights.
I've built machine learning models in R to pick stocks from the S&P500 to detect fraudulent credit card activity to market segmentation and targeted marketing.
The power of data science is endless. I am working to expand my arsenal of knowledge in data science and sharpen my skills by working on more interesting projects related to business and economics.
